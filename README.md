## Project Overview
In the effervescent Egyptian city in the 1st century AD stood the Great Library of Alexandria, a beacon of ancient knowledge. Among the scholars wandering the sacred halls was Héron, a brilliant mind renowned for his prowess and skill in mathematics, mechanics, and engineering. Our task is to assist Héron in restoring order to the Library by implementing sorting algorithms to organize the vast collection of papyrus and parchments.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Tri par sélection
- Tri à bulles
- Tri par insertion
- Tri fusion
- Tri rapide
- Tri par tas
- Tri à peigne

## Project Structure
- `sorting.py`: Contains the implementations of the sorting algorithms (functions, classes).
- `main.py`: Coordinates and executes the main code of the sorting tool.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining project context, algorithm details, and conclusions.

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `main.py` to execute the sorting tool.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a list of real numbers and select the desired sorting algorithm.
5. View the sorted result in the terminal.

- Ali: Implemented Implemented Tri rapide and Tri par tas algorithms, Tri par paigne assisted with documentation and testing.
- Authomani: Implemented Tri par insertion and Tri fusion algorithms, assisted with GUI implementation.
- Tarek: Implemented Tri par sélection and Tri à bulles algorithms, assisted with documentation and testing.

## Conclusion
Through collaborative efforts, we have successfully implemented a sorting tool using various algorithms. The project not only enhances our understanding of sorting algorithms but also provides a practical solution to organize ancient knowledge efficiently.
